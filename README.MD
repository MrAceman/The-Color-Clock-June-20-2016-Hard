## Color Clock - Hard Mode

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created June 20th, 2016.  The goal was to create a working HEX clock that also had the background color change per second.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to work on use of window.setInterval, Date (and associated property identifiers), conversion of numbers to hex, and applying JS changes to the background property using the DOM.

Note that this clock changes the background color, NOT based on the current hex time but rather on a truncated variable of the Date.now() method as this resulted in a more colorful effect. Editing the code to utilize the displayed hex value of the clock would be an easy change.
